The city of Flagstaff is so different to me but I've been enjoying my time here. I come from Phoenix so there's some getting used to. For example, the weather is a big change, I'm used to the 110 degree heat but now I'm going to need to get used to the freezing weather and snow over here. Also this city is tiny compared to Phoenix and there's not much to do. But the thing I wish Flagstaff had was an In-N-Out, like why doesn't a college town have an In-N-Out.
