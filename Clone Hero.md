I've recently been playing a game called Clone Hero a lot more than usual because I found an Xplorer guitar and man is that great. Clone Hero is a fan made game of Guitar Hero and you can play pretty much whatever song you want. The guitar I found looks so cool and feels great while playing. The buttons and the strum bar also feel really nice. The only problem is that the whammy bar is a bit loose so it falls down a bunch but it's not a big problem.
